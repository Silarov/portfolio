                <h1>About Me</h1><br>
                Hi! My name is Severin Probst. I'm a 17-year-old photographer based in a small village in Switzerland. I
                started photographing all the way back in 2019, where I used my mom's camera. I didn't have a clue what
                I was doing, but I immediately fell in love with photography. I started learning all the rules for
                composition, lighting, and color and started to get slowly better at it. Now, after over 3 years of
                pursuing this hobby, I can comfortably say that I know more or less what I'm doing. When I'm not behind
                a camera, I love listening to and making music. I play the electric guitar and bass and got started on
                learning saxophone.
                <br><br>
